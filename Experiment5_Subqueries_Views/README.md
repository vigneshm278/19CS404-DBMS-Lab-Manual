# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

*Types:*
- *Single-row subquery*:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- *Multiple-row subquery*:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- *Correlated subquery*:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

*Example:*
sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
*Create View:*
sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;

*Drop View:*
sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
